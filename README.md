## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- This project improved my FlexBox concepts.
- I also learnt the basics for transform techniques. 

### Continued development

- I will now move to next level of FlexBox and will try to make regular projects for the same. Further, I will try to learn and add transitions also.



### Useful resources

- [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) - I have been following this course for HTML and CSS
- [CSS Flexbox: A Complete Guide](https://sharkcoder.com/layout/flexbox) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand FlexBox. 
- [A Complete Guide to CSS Media Queries](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/) - This helped me in learning the basics of media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
